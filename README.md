# Module 11 Challenge - CryptoClustering

In this Challenge, we were required to demonstrate our understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA).  We used these tools to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. 

I have found that producing 3D plots makes it easier to view and understand the clusters.   While not required, I included 3D plots to suppliment the required plotting in this challenge.
